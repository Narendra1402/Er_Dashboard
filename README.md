- Searchable, filterable patient-level data:
  - ID, Name, Gender, Age
  - Race, Department, Admit Date
  - Wait Time, Admission Status



## 📈 Suggested Improvements

- **Patient Load** is increasing; hospital should prepare for higher patient volumes.
- **Wait Time Optimization** is crucial as over half the patients are not seen within 30 mins.
- **Tuesdays and afternoon hours** are most congested — suggest staffing boosts accordingly.
- **Racial Satisfaction Gap** exists — deeper root-cause analysis needed for equitable service.
- **Referral Accuracy** can be improved since a large number of patients fall under None category.



## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Data Preparation:** Power Query
- **Visualization:** Power BI Desktop
- **Data Model:** Star schema with filters on Date, Department, and Demographics
